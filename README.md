# SEC_WebScraping
form4WebScraping.py collects SEC Form 4 data and transforms the data to CSV Files. 2 CSV files are created for each company. (1 for derivative transactions, one for non-derivative transactions.)
If you need to combine the collected data you can use form4_combine_tables.py. This script will create 2 Microsoft Excel files. (If the files are larger tan 1 million lines additional files will be created.)
